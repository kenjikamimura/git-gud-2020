## 10. Add a third line and commit them

- Repeat step 9 and check the git log. You should see a third commit!
  ![LogCommit3](./images/LogCommit3.png "Log Commit 3")
- Congratulations! You have successfully added version control to your new file! The following steps help create a pull request to get these new changes into the remote repostory.

---

## **Collaboration**

## 11. Push your changes to your fork's remote repository

- The command below will push all the new commits to the master branch in your forked remote repository.
  (Note: origin is the default name given to the remote repository)

          git push origin master

## Create the Pull Request

- Navigate to your fork URL (e.g. https://github.com/sy133/git-gud-2020)
- Click on the "New Pull Request" button
  ![NewPR](./images/NewPullRequestButton.png "New PR")

- Check the fork you wish to make the pull request from is your personal forked repository master branch
  ![NewPRPage](./images/NewPullRequestPage.png "New PR Page")

- Click the green "Create pull request" button.
- Congratulations, you have successfully made a Pull Request to the remote repository. Now you will have to wait until the owner of the repository approves and merges your pull request.

## Seeing your changes

- Once your changes have been approved and merged, you can see your changes and other people's changes to the remote repository on https://github.com/kenjikamimura/git-gud-2020

- These changes are now part of the source of truth!
